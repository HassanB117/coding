# My Personal Code Space

This is my private code space on GitHub, where I explore and experiment with HTML, CSS, and other projects. It serves as a personal playground for coding exercises, small applications, and creative endeavors. While the content here is not intended for public use, I use this space to hone my skills, try out new ideas, and organize my code in a structured manner. Feel free to take a peek, but keep in mind that this repository is primarily for personal use.
